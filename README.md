# Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp Checkpoint

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **Gemini_2_0_flash_exp-checkpoint.ipynb**, which is designed for generating images using a deep learning model. The notebook leverages specific checkpoints to load model configurations and weights correctly. **Note:** The file's name includes the keyword "checkpoint" because the code depends on this naming convention to trigger the appropriate loading and processing logic. Renaming the file by removing "checkpoint" may lead to unsupported image generation outputs.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Generate images using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- **Key Feature:** Uses a naming convention (the inclusion of "checkpoint") to determine how the model loads its parameters.
- **Warning:** Changing the file name (especially removing "checkpoint") may bypass critical code paths and result in unsupported image outputs.
